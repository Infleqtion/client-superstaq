Superstaq for EeroQ
========================
For this tutorial, we will go over how to get started with using Superstaq to compile, optimize, and simulate circuits for the EeroQ Wonderlake device, an electron based quantum computer. We will go over the process of setting up a Superstaq provider and compiling circuits to an EeroQ backend, retrieving the optimized circuits. We will also demonstrate how to perform noisy simulations for EeroQ hardware.

Below, you will find links to identical tutorials that demonstrate Superstaq for EeroQ using either Qiskit or Cirq.

Superstaq for Hilbert
========================
For this tutorial, we will go over how to get started with using Superstaq to compile, optimize, and simulate circuits for [Hilbert](https://www.infleqtion.com/coldquantalabs), Infleqtion's gate-based cloud-accessible neutral atom quantum computer. We will go over the process of setting up a Superstaq provider and compiling circuits to an Infleqtion backend, retrieving the optimized circuits. By the end, we will provide a step-by-step guide to simulate a given circuit on Infleqtion's Hilbert simulator and get back the results!

Below, you will find links to identical tutorials that demonstrate Superstaq for Hilbert using either Qiskit or Cirq.

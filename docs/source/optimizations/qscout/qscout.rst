Superstaq for QSCOUT
========================
For this tutorial, we will go over how to get started with using Superstaq to compile, optimize, and simulate circuits for the QSCOUT backend. We will go over the process of setting up a Superstaq provider, compiling circuits for QSCOUT, and getting back the corresponding optimized circuits. 

This tutorial will also show you how to utilize the various features offered by Superstaq such as generating compiled circuit Jaqal programs, the ability to compile for a different entangling basis gates, as well as utilize swap mirroring techniques for a customized compilation. By the end, we will provide a step-by-step guide to simulate a given circuit for the QSCOUT backend and get back the results from the simulation!

Below, you will find links to identical tutorials that demonstrate Superstaq for QSCOUT using either Qiskit or Cirq.

SuperstaQ for ColdQuanta
========================
For this tutorial, we will go over how to get started with using Superstaq to compile, optimize, and simulate circuits for the Infleqtion Hilbert backend. We will go over the process of setting up a Superstaq provider and compiling circuits to an Infleqtion  backend, retrieving the optimized circuits. By the end, we will provide a step-by-step guide to simulate a given circuit on Infleqtion's Hilbert simulator and get back the results!

Below, you will find links to identical tutorials that demonstrate Superstaq for Hilbert using either Qiskit or Cirq.

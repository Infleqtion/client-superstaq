Superstaq for IBM
========================
For this tutorial, we will go over how to get started with using Superstaq to compile, optimize, and simulate circuits for the IBM Quantum backends. We will go over the process of setting up a Superstaq provider and compiling circuits to an IBM Quantum backend, retrieving the optimized circuits. 

This tutorial will also show you how to utilize the various features offered by Superstaq, such as generating compiled circuit Qiskit Pulse schedules. By the end, we will provide a step-by-step guide to simulate a given circuit for an IBM Quantum backend and get back the results from the simulation!

Below, you will find links to identical tutorials that demonstrate Superstaq for IBM Quantum using either Qiskit or Cirq.

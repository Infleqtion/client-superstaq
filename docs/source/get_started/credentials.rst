#. This will take you to the Swagger frontend page. Click on Authorize, enter your Superstaq API as the value, and click Authorize. Then click Close.
#. Expand the endpoints section by clicking on the arrow next to v0.2.0.
#. You will see a list of API endpoints. Click on any one to expand details and click "Try it out" to use any of the available endpoints.

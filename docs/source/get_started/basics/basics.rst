The Basics: Write Once, Target All
==================================
In the tutorials below, we demonstrate the basics of Superstaq and one of its key functionalities:

* **Write once**: Create a circuit and access the Superstaq API in either Cirq or Qiskit
* **Target all**: Submit your circuit to a variety of devices and simulators

Here, we assume you have a basic understanding of Python, as well as some familiartiy with Cirq or Qiskit. We think the best place to get started with these examples is to try them on our `Hub <https://hub.super.tech/>`_!

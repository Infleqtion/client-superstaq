To that, we will formulate the problem as a QUBO and try to find optimal weights for assets in a given portoflio. We will get many results using simulated annealing for our QUBO and then classically post-process to find the one that gives the actual highest Sharpe ratio. "

    "## Portfolio Risk Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Portfolio risk is measured by the standard deviation, $\\sigma$. The greater the standard deviation, the greater the risk. Given a portfolio, $P$, with two assets, $A$ and $B$, we represent the weights of the assets in the portfolio with $w_{i}$ (with $i =$ {A,B}), and the corresponding portfolio standard deviation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma_{P} = \\sqrt{w_{A}^{2}σ_{A}^{2} + w_{B}^{2}σ_{B}^{2}  + 2w_{A}w_{B}σ_{A}σ_{B}ρ_{{AB}}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given three assets ($A,B,$ and $C$) in $P$, our portfolio standard deviation would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma_{P} = \\sqrt{w_{A}^{2}σ_{A}^{2} + w_{B}^{2}σ_{B}^{2} + w_{C}^{2}σ_{C}^{2} + 2w_{A}w_{B}σ_{A}σ_{B}ρ_{{AB}} + 2w_{B}w_{C}σ_{B}σ_{C}ρ_{{BC}} + 2w_{A}w_{C}σ_{A}σ_{C}ρ_{{AC}}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\rho$ is a symmetric matrix that contains the correlation coefficient between an asset $i$ and asset $j$. The product ${\\sigma_{a_i}}{\\sigma_{a_j}}\\rho_{ij}$ = $\\text{Cov}_{ij}$ is also called the covariance of the assets $a_{i}$ and $a_{j}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, for $N$ assets = {$a_1,a_2,...,a_N$} in a portfolio $P$, the square of the portfolio standard deviation, in other words the variance, is given by the following formula:\n",
    "\n",

    "## Sharpe Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful measure to consider then, is the Sharpe Ratio -- which measures a portfolio's \"reward to risk\" ratio. To do this, we need to define the portfolio return, $R_{P}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R_{P} = \\sum_{i=1}^N w_{a_i}r_{a_{i}} $$\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\\sigma_{P}^2 - E[R_{P}]$$\n",

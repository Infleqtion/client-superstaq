QCVV: Quantum Characterisation, Validation and Verification
===========================================================

The Supermarq QCVV library provides a customizable toolkit for testing and characterizing
quantum devices. The toolkit can either be used with simulators or on live devices.

For a demonstration of how to implement a new experiment take a look at the following notebook

Alternatively for pre-build experiments that can be used out of the box see

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    qcvv_irb_css
    qcvv_su2_css
    qcvv_xeb_css

.. note::

    At present the QCVV library is only available in :code:`cirq-superstaq`.

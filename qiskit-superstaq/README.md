![qiskit-superstaq's default workflow](https://github.com/SupertechLabs/qiskit-superstaq/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

This package is used to access SuperstaQ via a Web API through [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/). Qiskit programmers
can take advantage of the applications, pulse level optimizations, and write-once-target-all
features of SuperstaQ with this package.


Please note that Python version `3.7` or higher is required. qiskit-superstaq and all of its
dependencies can be installed via:

```
python3 -m venv venv_qiskit_superstaq
source venv_qiskit_superstaq/bin/activate
pip install qiskit-superstaq

# Run the following to install dev requirements (required if you intend to run checks locally)
pip install .[dev]
```

### Creating and submitting a circuit through qiskit-superstaq
```python3

import qiskit
import qiskit_superstaq as qss

token = "Insert superstaq token that you received from https://superstaq.super.tech"

superstaq = qss.superstaq_provider.SuperstaQProvider(token)

backend = superstaq.get_backend("ibmq_qasm_simulator")
qc = qiskit.QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.measure(0, 0)
qc.measure(1, 1)

print(qc)

# Submitting a circuit to "ibmq_qasm_simulator". Providing the "dry-run" method parameter instructs SuperstaQ to simulate the circuit, and is available to free trial users.
job = backend.run(qc, shots=100, method="dry-run")
print(job.result().get_counts())
```

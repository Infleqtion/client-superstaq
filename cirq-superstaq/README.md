This package is used to access SuperstaQ via a Web API through [Cirq](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq).
Cirq programmers can take advantage of the applications, pulse level optimizations, and write-once-target-all
features of SuperstaQ with this package.


Please note that Python version `3.7` or higher is required. cirq-superstaq and all of its
dependencies can be installed via:

```
python3 -m venv venv_cirq_superstaq
source venv_cirq_superstaq/bin/activate
pip install cirq-superstaq

# Run the following to install dev requirements (required if you intend to run checks locally)
pip install .[dev]

```

### Creating and submitting a circuit through cirq-superstaq
```python
import cirq
import cirq_superstaq as css

q0 = cirq.LineQubit(0)
q1 = cirq.LineQubit(1)

circuit = cirq.Circuit(cirq.H(q0), cirq.CNOT(q0, q1), cirq.measure(q0))

service = css.Service(
    api_key="""Insert superstaq token that you received from https://superstaq.super.tech""",
    verbose=True,
)

# Submitting a circuit to "ibmq_qasm_simulator". Providing the "dry-run" method parameter instructs SuperstaQ to simulate the circuit, and is available to free trial users.
job = service.create_job(circuit=circuit, repetitions=1, target="ibmq_qasm_simulator", method="dry-run")
print("This is the job that's created ", job.status())
print(job.counts())
```

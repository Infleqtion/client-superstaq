# Setting up access and authentication to Cirq-SuperstaQ

Cirq-SuperstaQ is used to access [SuperstaQ](https://www.super.tech/about-superstaq/) via a Web API through [Cirq](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq). Cirq programmers can take advantage of the applications, pulse level optimizations, and write-once-target-all features of SuperstaQ with this package.

Please note that Python version `3.7` or higher is required.

## Accessing Cirq-SuperstaQ

Creating and submitting a circuit through Cirq-SuperstaQ requires an API access token obtained at https://superstaq.super.tech.

# Setting up access and authentication to Cirq-Superstaq

Cirq-Superstaq is used to access [Superstaq](https://www.infleqtion.com/superstaq) via a Web API through [Cirq](https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq). Cirq programmers can take advantage of the applications, pulse level optimizations, and write-once-target-all features of Superstaq with this package.

Please note that Python version `3.8` or higher is required.

## Accessing Cirq-Superstaq

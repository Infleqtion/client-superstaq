    "OQC's quantum computers are based on superconducting qubits. This technology implements qubits with electrical components that are similar to transistors. When placed in a very cold environment (colder than space), the materials of these components become superconducting which allows them to exhibit a property called the *Josephson effect*. The way this property is used to actually implement a qubit differs between manufacturers, but in essence all superconducting quantum computers rely on this effect. The different qubits are then grouped together on a *quantum chip* and the quantum gates are applied using microwave radiation.\n",
